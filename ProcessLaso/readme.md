####Feature

- General PC Optimization

 - Gaming Mode with Bitsum Highest Performance power plan - New version 2.0 of this feature!
 - SmartTrim - The first intelligent RAM manager
 
- Process Settings Automation
 - Persistent (saved) CPU, memory, and I/O priorities, CPU affinities, and other process settings
 - Disallowed processes, terminate problematic processes every time they are seen running
